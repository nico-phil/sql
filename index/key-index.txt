Key vs Non-Key Column database indexing

Key
    here, when we make a request, postgres scan the index, and get the the rows in the heap
    Create index g_idx on students(g); 


Non-Key Column
    here, postgres does scan only the index(the name is also indclude in the index), mean the name lives in the index
    data tructure. postges does not neet to fech the name in the table. 
    Create index g_idx on students(g) INCLUDE name;
