Data type

Character string type are genreral-perpose types.

1. char(n)/ character(n)
    - A fixed-length column where the character length is specified by n
    - ex: char(20) -  stores 20 characteres per row. If you insert fewer than 20 characteres, 
        postgres pads the rest of the column with spaces.
    - type char is part of the sql standard


2. varchar(n) / character varying
    - variable-length column where the maximum length is specified by n. if you insert fewer 
      characters than the maximum, postgres will not store extra space.
    - in large database, it save considerable space
    - include in the sql standar


3. text 
    - variable-length column of unlimited space
    - the max character string you can store in postgres is 1 gigabyte
    - the type text is not part of the sql standard


There is no substantial difference in performance between the three types. 
the varchar and text type can help save space.
